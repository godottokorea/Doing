# So excited! This is my first Android App!

It's a simple rng app where you can type in as many as 20 options to select from at random.
Great for picking students in a class, or menu items, or all the things you need to do.

If you are indecisive like me and don't care to much about what to do, but never sure what to do.
Try this =D
